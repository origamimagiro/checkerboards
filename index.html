        This is a website for listing square origami checkerboard models folded
        from a two-color square, ranked by efficiency.
        This website augments the listing found at
        <a href="http://www.budaiorigami.hu/en/chequered">Peter Budai's</a>
        website.

        Crease patterns are provided in .fold format where available,
        reproduced with permission from the authors. You can download all the
        crease patterns at once by
        <a href="https://github.com/origamimagiro/checkerboards/archive/refs/heads/main.zip">downloading the git repository</a>.
        You can also download a CSV file of the current listing <a id="csv">here</a>.

        Each model is classified with the following type annotations:
        <ul>
        <li>
        Models marked with "C" can fold into a <b>checkerboard</b> color-change pattern.
        </li>
        <li>
        Models marked with "S" are <b>seamless</b> (each color-change region is formed by a visible
        subset of a continuous crease pattern face, same as "clean" in Budai's
        listing).
        </li>
        <li>
        Models marked with "F" are <b>flippable</b> (each square can be
        independently "flipped" between white and color states via
        a simple local change to the model).
        Models that are <b>nearly flippable</b> are marked with "f",
        clarified in the notes.
        </li>
        <li>
        Models marked with "D" are <b>double-sided</b> (form a checkerboard
        pattern on both sides of the model).
        </li>
        <li>
        Models marked with "I" are <b>iso-area</b> (the crease pattern
        is the same under a reflection and rotation by 180 degrees).
        </li>
        <li>
        Models marked with "P" are <b>pureland</b> (can be folded via a sequence
        of only mountain and valley folds).
        </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
        The year column represents the year the model was designed.
        If multiple models were designed in the same year by the same author,
        we distinguish them via their number in the "#" column.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>Efficiencies</b> are listed as the ratio of the target grid side to
        to the side length of the starting square. Exact algebraic efficiencies
        are provided where available. Models that are most efficient for a
        particular grid size and type are highlighted in white. When evaluating
        efficiencies between types, seamless and flippable types both count as
        fuzzy.
        </p>
        <p>
        If you would like to contribute a model to this listing, please
        <a id="mail">email</a> us your contribution. Generally, we will only add
        a new model to the listing if it is the most efficient for its grid
        size and type at the time of submission, or would have been based on its
        year of creation.
