        Website for listing square origami checkerboard models folded from a
        two-color square, ranked by efficiency.
        This website augments the listing found at
        <a href="http://www.budaiorigami.hu/en/chequered">Peter Budai's</a>
        website.
        Crease patterns are provided in .fold format where available,
        reproduced with permission from the authors.
        </p>
        <p>
        Folded models are typed as either
        <b>seamless</b> (each color-change region is formed by a visible
        subset of a continuous crease pattern face, same as "clean" in Budai's
        listing), <b>fuzzy</b> (i.e., not seamless), or
        <b>flippable</b> (each grid cell can be flipped locally between
        white/color states via a single fold).
        </p>
        <p>
        The year column represents the year the model was designed.
        If multiple models were designed in the same year by the same author,
        we distinguish them via their number in the "#" column.
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>Efficiencies</b> are listed as the ratio of the target grid side to
        to the side length of the starting square. Exact algebraic efficiencies
        are provided where available. Models that are most efficient for a
        particular grid size and type are highlighted in white. When evaluating
        efficiencies between types, seamless and flippable types both count as
        fuzzy.
